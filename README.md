## 📂 Featured Projects

- 🔍 [car-co2emissions-prediction](https://github.com/Tejesvar/car-co2emissions-prediction)  
  predicts CO2 emissions of vehicles based on features like engine size, fuel consumption, and vehicle class. Multiple regression models are used to evaluate performance and accuracy.

- 📊 [Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/Tejesvar/logistic-regression-customer-churn)  
  This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn. The dataset was analyzed and preprocessed to identify patterns that help businesses retain customers.
  
- 🧠 [Image Classification with CNN](https://github.com/Tejesvar/cifar10_classification)  
  Deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify images across multiple categories.

- 🏏 [eda-telecom-churn-dataset](https://github.com/Tejesvar/eda-telecom-churn-dataset)  
  performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer churn dataset. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn.
